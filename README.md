# Hello-World
Test repository

Hello, I am trying to use github for demo swift programs.  It seems wrong that people can only download an entire repository as it may have all my swift demos in it.  If they just want one file from one demo they have to get it all to find that one file.  So I guess I need to do the work of making separate repositories for each demo?  That seems lame.
